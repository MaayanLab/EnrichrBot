getting significant snps:
filter out for all snps with original pvalue of < 5e-8
filter out for non-low confidence variants (column in original data)
sort remaining snps by pvalue
loop through chromosomes and make sure neighboring snps are no less than 500kbp apart

choose closest gene based on either the transcription start site or the transcription end site -- the minimum of all of those distances is where the snp gets assigned

perfect overlap with eric's aspirin results (snps and genes)
