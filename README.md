# EnrichrBot

These scripts are for running the Enrichr bot.

- `DoEnrichrForLookupTable.py`: Use the lookup table to submit Enrichr lists and take screenshots of Enrichr for each list.
- `SWASbot_collect.py`: Download SbotGwa's posts and extract the identifier being posted. Then use the Enrichr-processed results file to reply with the enrichr link and the screenshot.
