data -> primary_snapshot_data -> allele_annotations -> assembly_annotation -> genes -> locus

1. get rsid from tsv created from tabix command
2. format so only number (remove 'rs')
3. create request url
4. call request url
5. store in variable 'data'
6. get name of gene with the following: data['primary_snapshot_data']['allele_annotations'][0]['assembly_annotation'][0]['genes'][0]['locus']
7. use time.sleep(1) to limit to 1 request/second (noted on API website)
